# Effort and assistance declaration

Approximate total effort: 2 to 3 focused hours for the implementation review,
comparison with reference projects, safety hardening, CLI evidence generation,
frontend review, and verification.

Human work included requirement interpretation, architectural decisions, review
of the attached projects, selection of the conflict policy, inspection of
customer-facing outputs, and acceptance of the final evidence.

AI assistance was used for code search, implementation suggestions, test ideas,
regex review, documentation drafting, and command execution. Every generated
change was checked against `spec.md`, the summary requirements, tests, and the
actual 20-report batch output.

The most important review corrections were the removal of unrestricted note
copying, narrowing of a false-positive security detector, and replacement of
internal validation wording in customer-facing caveats. The corrections were
retested with the backend suite and deterministic batch run.
